## Keywords
**Backoffice**

Backoffice software refers to the systems and applications that support the operational and administrative functions of a business, as opposed to the customer-facing front-office systems. These operational and administrative functions include tasks such as accounting, inventory management, human resources, and customer service. Backoffice software can also include tools for data management, reporting and analytics, and IT management. These systems are generally used by administrative staff and managers, rather than front-line employees or customers. The goal of backoffice software is to automate and streamline these processes, making them more efficient and accurate, and allowing staff to focus on more important tasks.

**Trading automation**
Trading automation refers to the use of computer programs and algorithms to execute trades on financial markets, such as the stock market or the foreign exchange market. These programs use mathematical models and historical data to identify trading opportunities and make decisions to buy or sell assets. The use of trading automation can help traders to make more efficient and effective trades, as well as to reduce the risk of human error. Additionally, trading automation can also help traders to manage their portfolio more effectively and to take advantage of market conditions in real time.

**Jupyter notebooks**
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning. Jupyter Notebook supports many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and others, and allows users to mix code, markdown, and multimedia in a single document. It is widely used in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning communities and is often used in educational settings.
